Pix Store is a mock e-commerce site built with React functional components, Context API and Hooks. The idea is for users to visit the site, look at the available pictures, choose some of them to be printed so that they can order them to be printed and shipped to them. Images on the list can be favorited or added to the cart and then on the cart page, a user can see the images he added and then proceed to place his/her order.
